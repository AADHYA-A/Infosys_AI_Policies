# 🧠 AI Policy Navigator  
### FastAPI-Based Project | Infosys Internship

## 📘 Overview
**AI Policy Navigator** is an AI-powered application designed to help users explore, understand, and retrieve information about various government and organizational **AI policies**.  
Built using **FastAPI**, **machine learning**, and **natural language processing (NLP)**, the system allows users to enter a policy-related query and receive the most relevant policies and summaries using **cosine similarity** on TF-IDF representations.

This project was developed as part of my **Infosys Internship**, focusing on the intersection of **AI, NLP, and public policy analytics**.
